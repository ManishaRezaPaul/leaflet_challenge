# leaflet_challenge

## Challenge Objective
Using leaflet, plot the earthquake data on a map

## Analysing the dataset
1. Skim through the dataset to ensure the right section of the dataset is selected to plot the data
2. Use createFeatures, pointToLayer and onEachFeature functions to plot on the map and change the markers colors as per the depth of the earthquake and change the size of the markers as per the magnitude of the earthquake.
